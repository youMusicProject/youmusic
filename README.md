#### 2. Future implementations

- React-Query
- Styled components
- Delete songs in playlist 

#### 3. Advantages of using React

- React requires less code compared to other development platforms.
- Reusable components: This makes the application more scalable and easier to maintain as errors will occur in the component's own functionality or in its   communication with the rest.
- Improves the user experience when navigating the web application, the speed at which pages load and facilitates the maintenance of the application.
